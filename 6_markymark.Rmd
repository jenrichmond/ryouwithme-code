# What about code?
We can intersperse notes and code "chunks". Use the insert pull down, or hotkey alt-command-I (mac). Run the code in each chunk using the green arrow or hotkey Ctrl-shift-enter. 

#load packages
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

#read in the beaches data
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
beaches <- read_csv("sydneybeaches.csv")
```
# plot mean bug levels by site
```{r}
beaches %>%
  group_by(Site) %>%
  summarise(meanbugs = mean(`Enterococci (cfu/100ml)`, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Site, y= meanbugs)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()
```

# Export formats

The default format is html, you can also export to pdf or word.  Use the pulldown on the knit menu to export to another format. Watch out, pdf is finickity. You need to also have some LaTex (pronounced Lah-Tech) thing also installed. Try installing the `tinytex` package 

```{r}
install.package("tinytex")
library(tinytex)
```
