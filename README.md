# ryouwithme-code

This repo contains scraps of code that Jenny wrote while compiling [#RYouWithMe](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/), a beginners course that walks new users through the process of getting your data into RStudio, cleaning it up, visualising it, and writing a report in RMarkdown. 

The repo for the RLadiesSydney website (and RYouWithMe course) is in this [github repo](https://github.com/jenrichmond/RLadiesSydney-blogdown)

The RYouWithMe videos that are embedded in the course are also available on youtube in these playlists.
